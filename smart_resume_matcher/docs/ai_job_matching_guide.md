# AI Job Matching: User Guide

## What is AI Job Matching?

The AI Job Matching feature uses advanced algorithms to analyze your resume and find the jobs that best match your unique profile. Unlike traditional job searches that rely on keywords, our AI looks at your skills, experience level, and qualifications to find jobs where you have the highest chance of success.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Upload Your Resume
Before using AI Job Matching, make sure you've uploaded your resume. The system will automatically extract key information like:
- Technical and soft skills

There are several ways to access the AI Job Matching feature:
- Click on "AI Job Matches" in the navigation menu
- Use the "Find Matches" button on your dashboard
- Click "Try AI Job Matching" on the job search page

### Step 3: Find Your Perfect Matches
You can find AI-powered job matches in two ways:

**Auto-Match**
- Click the "Auto-Match" or "Find My Perfect Job Matches" button
- The system will automatically generate an optimal search query based on your resume
- You'll see job matches ranked by match percentage

**Custom Search**
- Enter specific keywords and location (optional)
- Click "Search" to find matches for your custom criteria
- Results will still be AI-ranked based on your resume profile

## Understanding Match Scores

Each job is assigned a match score from 0-100% based on:

| Score Range | Match Quality | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| 75-100% | Excellent | You have most or all of the required skills and experience |
| 50-74% | Good | You have many of the required skills but may be missing some |
| 30-49% | Fair | You have some relevant skills but significant gaps exist |
| 0-29% | Poor | Your profile doesn't closely match the job requirements |

## Match Analysis

For each job, you can see:

1. **Overall Match Score**: The percentage match between your resume and the job
2. **Matching Skills**: Skills in your resume that match the job requirements
3. **Missing Skills**: Skills mentioned in the job that aren't in your resume
4. **Experience Level Match**: How well your experience level aligns with the job

## Tips for Better Matches

1. **Complete Your Resume**: The more details in your resume, the better the matches will be
2. **Update Your Skills**: Make sure all your current skills are included in your resume
3. **Be Specific**: Include specific technologies, tools, and frameworks you've used
4. **Use Standard Terms**: Use industry-standard terms for skills and job titles
5. **Include Experience Level**: Make sure your years of experience and seniority are clear
